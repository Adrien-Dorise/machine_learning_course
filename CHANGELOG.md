# v1.0.0 - Added instructions on all notebooks

- The course is now fully operational!
- The notebooks all have their markdown instructions
- Added README
- Added Licence

# v0.3.0 - Interpretability exercises

- Used COMPAS dataset to analyse bias.
- First classification with linear SVM, without the possibility to interpret
- Then classification with a decision tree to see relevant features
- Need to analyse false positives between ethnic groups to analyse bias.


# v0.2.0 - Non-supervised learning

## Clustering
- Clustering notebook aimed to compare the clustering methods on various datasets
- Need to analyse the clusters using evaluation metrics
- Datasets are given in a separate datasets folder
- Distance metrics can be adjusted in its own scripts
- Evaluations are given in a separate script

## Dimensionality reduction
- Iris example of classification is taken back
- Need to plot the PCA to visualise all features in 2D
- Evaluate impact on classification


# v0.1.0 - Supervised learning

## Regression notebook 
  - Created a polynomial dataset
  - The student has to compare the fit between linear, polynomial and logistic regression
  
## Classification notebook 
- 2 classification notebooks
- First one is about synthetic blob dataset
- Second one about Iris dataset
