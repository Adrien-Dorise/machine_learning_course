# üß† Machine Learning Course ‚Äì Hands-on Projects

Welcome to the repository of practical projects for the **Machine Learning Course**. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning through a blend of theory and hands-on coding in **Jupyter Notebooks**.

The course is structured into three main parts:
1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
3. **Fairness and Interpretability**

Throughout the course, you'll engage in projects to solidify your understanding and gain practical skills in implementing machine learning algorithms.

## üìö Course Structure

### 1. Supervised Learning Projects
Explore regression and classification algorithms with practical examples.

- `1_regression/`  
  Apply **linear** and **polynomial regression** techniques on synthetic datasets and evaluate performance using metrics like MSE and R¬≤.

- `2_classification/`  
  Use the **Iris dataset** to practice classification with models like **K-NN**, **SVM**, **Random Forest**,..., and evaluate using a **confusion matrix**.

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning Projects
Dive into clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.

- `1_clustering/`  
  Perform **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** or other clustering methods on various datasets. Evaluate clustering performance using internal and external metrics.

- `2_dimensionality_reduction/`  
  Apply **PCA** and **t-SNE** to reduce dimensionality and improve classification on the **MNIST dataset**.

---

### 3. Bias and Interpretability Study

- `3_fairness/`  
  Analyze bias in the **COMPAS dataset** and discuss the implications of machine learning predictions in real-world applications. Understand model fairness and interpretability.
